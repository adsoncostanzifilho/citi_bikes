# Summary

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Let's first take a look at the general numbers!

--

* The data set is from `r db_metrics$min_date` to `r as.Date(db_metrics$max_date)`.

> There is a gap with NO DATA from 2016-09-30 to 2017-04-01!

--

* There were a total of **`r db_metrics$n_trips` trips** in this period.

--

* The average duration of a trip is **`r round(db_metrics$tripduration_avg/60, 0)` minutes**.

> with a stadard deviation equal to **`r round(db_metrics$tripduration_sd/60/60, 0)` hours**!

--

* The maximum duration of a trip was **`r round(db_metrics$tripduration_max/60/60, 0)` hours**.

--

* The minimum duration of a trip was **`r round(db_metrics$tripduration_min/60, 0)` minutes**.

# Historic Metrics

# Historic Metrics - Number of Trips

* Seasonal behavior!

> The number of trips is higher in **Summer** and decreases in **Winter**!

* The number of trips is **increasing over time**!

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE }
require(echarts4r)
require(dplyr)

db_over_time <- readRDS('../data/db_over_time.rds')

```

# Historic Metrics - Average Trips Duration

* Outlier detected at 2014-02-13 (average trip of 81 minutes).

* **Seasonal behavior is not as strong**, but in general travel duration in Summer is longer than in Winter.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE }

# User Behavior

# User Behavior - Hour of the day

* There are **more bike trips at 5pm and 6pm**!

* From midnight to 6am the number of trips is very low!

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE }

```

# User Behavior - Day of the week

* There are **more bike rides** on **Thursdays** and **Tuesdays**, but the duration of trips on these days is not long.

* **Saturday** and **Sunday** presented **more long trips duration** in average.

> As the number of bikes are the same and, the trips are longer during the weekend that possible explains the low number of rides on Saturday and Sunday!

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE }

# User Behavior - Gender

* **Men** presented **more bike rides** than Women, but the **duration of trips are longer for Women**.

# User Behavior - User Type

> Customer: User with 24 hour pass or 7 day pass.

> Subscriber: Annual membership.

* **"Subscribers"** presented **more bike rides** than "Customers", but the **duration of trips are longer for "Customers"**.

# User Behavior - Age

* There are some **errors in the register of the birth year** (users with more than 100 years old).

> These errors could represent fraud or problems during the registration process.

> It was removed the users with ages higher than 70 years old.

* From 16 to 30 years old, the older the more bike rides.

* From 31 to 70 years old, the older the fewer bike rides.

# Next Steps


---

# Next Steps

* Forecast model to predict the increase in the number of trips.

* Cluster model to understand the different groups of users.

> Different plans for differnt users!

* **More bikes on tourist attractions (mainly during the Summer weekends)!**
